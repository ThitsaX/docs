# 📘 Platform Documentation

Welcome to the technical documentation for **platform security and architecture** within the **Mojaloop ecosystem**.

This site focuses on how the platform is **actually implemented and operated**, rather than abstract or theoretical designs.

## 🔐 Security Architecture

- **[Hub ↔ PM4ML Security Architecture](hub-pm4ml-security-architecture)**  
  Describes the end-to-end security model between the Hub and PM4ML, including:
  - Mutual TLS (mTLS) for transport-level security  
  - JWS for application-level message signing  
  - Certificate lifecycle and rotation  
  - Trust boundaries and ownership

## 🚧 Upcoming Documentation

The following sections are planned and will be published incrementally:

- 🏗 **Architecture Overview**
- 🔁 **Certificate & Key Management**
- 🚨 **Incident & Failure Scenarios**
- 📐 **Environment & Capacity Model**
- ⚙️ **Operational Runbooks**

These documents will reflect **validated production behavior** and operational best practices.
